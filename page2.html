		<h1 class="title">Product Property of Logarithms</h1>
		<p>
			As with all mathematical concepts, logarithms have different properties.
			The first of these that we will be discussing is the product property.
			Let's take a look at how the HMH textbook defines this property.
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">
			The logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of the logarithm of its
			factors
		</p>
		<p>
			This might seem slightly confusing. However, we can break this down.
			Imagine that we have a logarithmic equation like this \(\log_2 15\). The
			sum of the logarithms of 15's factors is equal to \(log_2 15\). First,
			find two factors: We will be choosing 5 and 3, but 1 and 15 work equally
			as fine. Now, we will add the logarithm of both of these factors, with the
			same base as the original logarithm, 2. It should look something as
			follows: \(\log_2 5 + log_2 3\).<br />Referring back to the definition,
			adding these two should, in theory, equal \(\log_2 15\). Does this work?
			Let's plug it into a calculator to check. \(log_2 15 &asymp; 3.907\), and
			\(\log_2 5 + log_2 3 &asymp; 3.907\) as well! Similarly, we can turn
			\(\log_2 5 + log_2 3\) back into \(\log_2 15\).
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			Now, let's perform the usual mathematic abstraction. We get the following
			equation.
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">
			For any positive numbers \(m\), \(n\), and \(b\) (\(b \ne 1\)), \(\log_b
			mn = log_b m+log_b n\)
		</p>

		<h1 class="title">Product Property Examples</h1>
		<p>Simplify this equation:</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(log_{216} 12 + log_{216} 18\)</p>
		<p>
			From what we've learned, the logarithm of a product is equal to the sum of
			the logarithm of its factors. We converted one logarithm to multiple.
			However, let's undo this process. The two factors, instead, are 12 and 18.
			We can multiply them to get this: \(log_{216}(12*18)\), or simplified:
			\(log_{216} 216\). We can tell that this is, in fact, 1!
		</p>
		<p>Represent the following equations in <i>1</i> logarithm:</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(log 3 + log 5\)</p>
		<p>
			This is very similar to what we had in the previous example. Let's
			multiply the 3 and 5 together: \(log (3 * 5)\). Simplify: \(log 15\). And
			there we have it!
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(log 2 + log 4 + log 6\)</p>
		<p>
			This looks slightly different, doesn't it? However, let's do this part by
			part. First, we will simplify the logarithm of 2 and 4. We follow the
			steps above to get \(log 8 + log 6\). Next, we do the same thing with the
			8 and the 6. The answer is \(log 48\).
