		<h1 class="title">Inverse Properties of Logarithms and Exponents</h1>
		<p>
			This property is slightly different from the previous properties that were
			explained. Instead of the usual logarithm manipulation, the Inverse
			Property of Logarithms and Exponents (as its name states!) is a way to
			cancel out logarithms and exponent using inverses. Let's see what HMH has
			to say about this property.
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">
			For any base \(b\) such that \(b>0\) and \(b \ne 1\),<br />\(\log_b b^{x}
			= x\), and \(b^{\log_{b} x} = x\)
		</p>
		<p>
			As you can see, the definition of this property is quite simple. When you
			recognize any of these cases when you are problem-solving, you should know
			that you can cancel out a part of the expression. "Canceling out" is a
			fancy way to say remove two inverses. For example, in \(1 - 1 + 2\), we
			can cancel out the ones (as they invert each other), and just leave a 2.
			Similarly with exponents, in \(\log_5 5^2\), the logarithm with base 5 and
			the 5 itself cancel, leaving just the exponent, 2. Something to pay
			attention to is that when you can cancel, there are usually two of the
			same numbers. When you see this happen along with logarithms and
			exponents, keep a sharp eye out for the ability to apply the Inverse
			Properties of Logarithms and Exponents!
		</p>

		<h1 class="title">Inverse Property Examples</h1>
		<p>Simplify this expression:</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(\log 10^{x}\)</p>
		<p>
			You might not think that the inverse property is at all applicable here;
			it appears that there are no two same terms. However, remember that the
			given expression is equivalent to this: \(\log_{10} 10^{x}\). Now, we see
			that the two 10's may cancel out, to leave us with just the answer: \(x\).
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(6^{log_6 7}\)</p>
		<p>
			This one is slightly more obvious, as the 6 to the power of the logarithm
			of base 6 cancel out, leaving simply 7. The answer is \(7\).
		</p>
		<p>Evaluate this expression using the Inverse Property:</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(log_4 256\)</p>
		<p>
			We may notice that the latter 256 is equivalent to \(4 * 4 * 4 * 4\), or
			\(4^4\). Writing this into the expression, we get \(log_4 4^4\). What do
			we notice? We see that the logarithm's base (4) and the four itself
			cancel, leaving the exponent behind. We get that \(log_4 4^4 = 4\). The
			answer is \(4\).
		</p>
		<p>Solve for \(x\):</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(\log_8 8^x = log 100\)</p>
		<p>
			This is a simple equation, where we have to solve for \(x\). First, we
			notice that on the left side, the logarithm of base 8 and 8 cancels,
			leaving \(x\). Now, we solve the logarithm on the left-hand side, getting
			2. (\(log 100 = 2\)) Finally, we get \(x = 2\), meaning that the final
			answer is \(2\).
