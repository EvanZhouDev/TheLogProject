		<h1 class="title">Power Property of Logarithms</h1>
		<p>
			Remember the Product Property of Logarithms? Well, the power property of
			logarithms builds on that, and simplifies having to do multiple
			calculations! Let's take a look at the definition of such a property in
			the HMH textbook.
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">
			The logarithm of a power is the product of the exponent and the logarithm
			of the base
		</p>
		<p>
			The product property states that \(\log_b mn = \log_b m+\log_b n\), for
			any positive numbers \(m\), \(n\), and \(b\) (\(b \ne 1\)). Let's look at
			how this would work with exponents. \(\log10^2\) would be the same thing
			as \(\log10 * 10\), or \(\log10 + \log10\). And that would be the same
			thing as \(2 * \log10\). What about this: \(\log10^3\)? Equivalent to
			\(\log(10 * 10 * 10)\), we can use the product property twice to get
			\(\log10 + \log10 + \log10\), which is \(3 \log10\). See a pattern? Here's
			the algebraic visualization of the Power Property of Logarithms
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">
			For any real numbers \(p\), and positive numbers \(a\), and \(b\) (\(b \ne
			1\)), \(\log_b a^p = p * \log_b a\)
		</p>
		<p>
			This is just a shortcut (as mathematicians seem to always take) for the
			product property&mdash;though a handy one!
		</p>

		<h1 class="title">Power Property Examples</h1>
		<p>Use the power property of exponents to simplify these equations:</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(\log5^{60}\)</p>
		<p>
			Looking at this, we know we cannot use the Product Property 60 times.
			That's just too tedious! We have to use the Power Property. Calling upon
			it, we simply move the exponent from the inside of the logarithm, and
			multiply it to the start, something like this: \(60\log5\). It's as simple
			as that, without the repetition!
		</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(\log12^{5}+log3^{5}\)</p>
		<p>
			Let's take this one step by step. First, use the Power Property to extract the fives. You will get \(5\log12 + 5\log3\). Now, to simplify further, we factor 5 out: \(5(\log12 + \log3)\). Next, add the logarithms: \(5(\log36)\). Finally, we get our answer: \(5\log36\).
		</p>
		<p>Evaluate this expression:</p>
		<p class="importantInformation">\(\log10^{100}\)</p>
		<p>
			Once again, using the product property wouldn't work! However, we can use
			the product property like so: moving the exponent 100 from inside to out,
			we get \(100\log10\). Now, we realize that the logarithm part can be
			evaluated to one. Thus, we get the following: \(100*1\), or simply 100.
			Note that this can also be done with the inverse property, taught in the
			next lesson.
